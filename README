	This is a simulation of an ATM with a few functionalities which I will descibe. As a specification, it was made using simple linked lists and it has as purpose to retention in a database the attributes of a card(such as: card number, pin, CVV, expiry date, balance, history of operations...) grouped in a subset using a specified formula(position in subset list = sum of a card digits % max number in database) using linked lists and data structures. Further, I will introduce you in the functionalities:

		- all_substes is a linked list where, in every cell, is stored a simple list with cards on a specified position
		- the list with the cards stores also a linked list being the card's history

		Summarily, the operations that can be performed on a card are divided into two categories:
			- the operations of an administrator:
				- resize the database if it is out of memory
				- add a card in a database
				- delete a card from database
				- unblock a card
				- reverse a transaction


			- the operations of a client:
				- insert the card in the ATM
				- recharge the card
				- withdrawl a specified sum
				- change the pin
				- can see the balance
				- transfer funds
